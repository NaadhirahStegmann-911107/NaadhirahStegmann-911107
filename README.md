## Hi there 👋
Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋
Hi, I'm Naadhirah Stegmann, a passionate software developer with a focus on pretty much everything right since I am still a student but I love React and TypeScript. I love building innovative solutions and contributing to meaningful projects that make an impact. My journey in tech is driven by curiosity, creativity, and a desire to continuously learn and grow.

🚀 About Me

Background: Curently a student with CodeSpace and I love every minute of it (including all the long, sleepless nights and being fueled by coffee and pastries, yum)
Current Focus: Curently learning about React API and discovering TypeScript
Career Goals: One day being involved in DevOp projects or even Cybersecurity
Fun Fact: When Im not coding, I am very busy mom of two Kids and three fur-babies and a loving husband who loves my crazy everyday (and I love his)


🛠️ Skills & Technologies
Here are some of the tools and technologies I work with:

Languages: Javascript and the basics in CSS
Frameworks: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
Tools: Github and VSCode
Other: Work in progress


🌟 Featured Projects
These are some of my favorite projects that showcase my skills and passion:

Pet Validation Website (https://github.com/NaadhirahStegmann-911107/Module_1_NAASTE24037_PTO2409_Group_A_Naadhirah-Stegmann_JSL01):building a virtual pet adoption website, and you need to create a JavaScript function that checks if the user has entered valid pet adoption details. Write a function that takes a string as input and validates if it follows a specific syntax, such as starting with "pet_" followed by a combination of letters and numbers. If the input follows the syntax, return "Valid Syntax," otherwise, return "Invalid Syntax."Tech Stack: Simple JavaScript

Mars Climate Orbitor Challenge (https://github.com/NaadhirahStegmann-911107/NAASTE24037_PTO2409_Group_A_Naadhirah-Stegmann_DJS01):The Mars Climate Orbiter incident in 1999 is a stark reminder of the importance of precision in space missions, highlighting how a simple unit mismatch led to the loss of the spacecraft. This challenge seeks to simulate similar challenges in a spacecraft navigation system, emphasising the need for accuracy in calculations.
Challenge Overview
This challenge invites students to debug, refactor, and enhance JavaScript functions designed for determining the trajectory of a spacecraft. The initial functions are flawed and may result in incorrect calculations. Tech Stack: Dynamic JavaScript

Whole Number Divider (https://github.com/NaadhirahStegmann-911107/NAASTE24037_PTO2409_Group_A_Naadhirah-Stegmann_DJS02):This project focuses on enhancing a web-based Whole Number Divider application. It's designed to help students apply their knowledge of error handling, guided by specific user stories. Before proceeding, familiarise yourself with the Gherkin syntax, a crucial tool for understanding user stories and requirements. Refer to the provided reading materials for a comprehensive guide. Below is the HTML and JavaScript code for a “Whole Number Divider”. At the moment it only meets two user stories (see below under “Resolved Stories”). Please ensure that it meets all user stories listed below:

This exercise provides user stories in the Gherkin syntax. Please make sure you understand the use and meaning of this syntax before continuing. Check out this resource from Cucumber.
Tech Stack: JavaScript with Gherkin Syntax
